# python-DataScience-package-intro
1. this repo contains several python packages that are used for data science. 
2. it has contained seaborn(for visualization),emcee(for Markov chain Monte Carlo),pandas_profiling(for EDA),scikit-learn(for ml and please refer to my another repo called Machine-Learning due to its relatively richer content).
3. this data-science repo will be updated till my interest in data-science(or ML) burns out.
4. i really appreciate your watch and star!ğŸ¤ªğŸ¤ªğŸ¤ªğŸ¤ª
